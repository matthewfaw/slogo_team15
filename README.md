## Roles

Matthew Faw - backend, AST, Nodes
George Bernard - frontend 
Kayla Schultz - frontend
Hannah Fuchshuber - backend, Text Parser, Commands

## Resources
Used Java APIs

## Testing Material
Used Eclipse debugger

## Data required by the project
All in file: src.resources 
All the different resource files are crucial to running the program

## Information about using the Program
Pretty straight forward. We implemented mostly everything, although we did not implement recursion. So of the front-to-back communication might be buggy. But everything else should function.

## Bugs
Askwih[] for the multiple turtle commands does not work, so don't try it! Also updating the background color information in the top left of the screen will not actually update the background color (it was working at some point... I think we can go back into the commits and find where). 

## Extra Features
We implemented nested scopes, not just scopes for different functions. Also the command fd id will move each turtle differently depending on their specific id.

## Impressions

## Things George Bernard Has Written or Sufficiently Messed With (For Rhondu)
It's easier to go by package than by class specifically. 
I wrote: 
+ Every Acceptor Interface
+ All the Sender Interfaces
+ Half of the ApplicationController and ApplicationScene
+ Error Viewing Module, ImageColorModule, TextEditor, Toolbar, 1/2 TurtleBox, TurtleState, and IViewModule interface
+ Language Switcher Interface + enum
+ 1/4 observer relationships
+ All of Router
